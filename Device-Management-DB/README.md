### Device Management Database

This project was created for the first project of the [Analytics 103 course](https://study.com/academy/course/analytics-103-intro-to-relational-databases-sql.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com). I did this to expand my knowledge of SQL as well as to pursue a college degree from Western Governor's University.

This repository holds the scripts I made to create the device management database and to query it. The way that I normalized the data and my report on this process are not included, as this repository is intended as a point of reference for people who need help with the assignment rather than as a means of cheating.
