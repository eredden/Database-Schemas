### Order Management Database

This project was created for the second project of the [Analytics 103 course](https://study.com/academy/course/analytics-103-intro-to-relational-databases-sql.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com). I did this to expand my knowledge of SQL as well as to pursue a college degree from Western Governor's University.

This repository holds the scripts I made to normalize the order management database. The way that I normalized the data and my report on this process are not included, as this repository is intended as a point of reference for people who need help with the assignment rather than as a means of cheating.

The scripts in the `src` folder should be ran in the following order in MySQL Workbench:
1. `CreateTables.sql`
2. `AlterProductsTable.sql`
3. `AlterOrdersTable.sql`
4. `AlterCustomersTable.sql`
