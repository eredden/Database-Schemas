### Book Borrowing Database

This project was created for the [Computer Science 204 course](https://study.com/academy/course/computer-science-204-database-programming.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com). I did this to expand my knowledge of SQL as well as to pursue a college degree from Western Governor's University.

All scripts can be found in the `src` folder. `FullAssignmentScript.sql` contains all of the code in a single script file, with the other scripts containing individual sections of the original script.
