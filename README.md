# Database Schemas

### Book Borrowing Database

This project was created for the [Computer Science 204 course](https://study.com/academy/course/computer-science-204-database-programming.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com).

All scripts can be found in the `Book-Borrowing-DB/src` folder. `FullAssignmentScript.sql` contains all of the code in a single script file, with the other scripts containing individual sections of the original script.

### Device Management Database

This project was created for the first project of the [Analytics 103 course](https://study.com/academy/course/analytics-103-intro-to-relational-databases-sql.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com).

This repository (specifically  `Device-Management-DB/src`) holds the scripts I made to create the device management database and to query it. The way that I normalized the data and my report on this process are not included, as this repository is intended as a point of reference for people who need help with the assignment rather than as a means of cheating.

### Order Management Database

This project was created for the second project of the [Analytics 103 course](https://study.com/academy/course/analytics-103-intro-to-relational-databases-sql.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com).

This repository holds the scripts I made to normalize the order management database. The way that I normalized the data and my report on this process are not included, as this repository is intended as a point of reference for people who need help with the assignment rather than as a means of cheating.

The scripts in the `Order-Management-DB/src` folder should be ran in the following order in MySQL Workbench:
1. `CreateTables.sql`
2. `AlterProductsTable.sql`
3. `AlterOrdersTable.sql`
4. `AlterCustomersTable.sql`
